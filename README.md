Module 4: Lab 4


Number I/O & Conditionals
Write a program that accepts both the interest rate and the amount of a loan (both numbers).
Check:
* The interest rate of the loan is between 1 and 18 percent
* The amount of the loan is between $100 and $1000.
Determine the cost of the loan fees:
* $20 – if the loan is between $100 and $500.
* $55 – if the loan is more than $500.
Calculate the simple interest paid on the loan.
Display the following:
* Requested amount of the loan.
* Interest rate.
* Sum of interest and fees for the loan.

while & do-while loops
V1: Write a program using a while loop that prompts the user to enter an integer between 1 and 50.
The program will then display all of the even integers starting with the number entered and working back to 0.


V2: Rewrite the preceding program to use a do-while loop instead of a while loop.

nested loops

Write a program that displays an upside-down right triangle made of asterisks for a user-specified base length.

The triangle below is created for the input of four:

'****

'***

'**

'*

(not including the preceding ' and extra lines)

6c More loops: Fibonacci
Write a program to generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified ending number.


For example, if the user entered 25 the Fibonacci sequence would be:


1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21


Hint: It is easier (possible?) with more than 2 variables.
